# Eduministic

## 💡 Inspiration
As young children, we watched our mothers mix and bake cookies and cakes but little did we realize she was a chemist. We enjoyed many delicious meals with different flavors but gave no consideration to the complex chemical laboratory we call the human body, digesting this food and building them into tissue and other chemical compounds for the body. We want to build a web app that will make all appreciate this marvel of the human body.

## 💻 What it does
Chemistry seems obscured and difficult to understand for many this is due to the fact that just reading from a textbook is not enough for such a practical topic.
Eduministic is adopting a different approach to bringing chemistry home by simplifying the details that seemed difficult for many to understand using 3D images, videos, and augmented reality of experiments. 

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Hedera: For smart contract
- Firebase: For user authentication
- Three.js: For 3D rendering
- echo3D: For Augmented Reality

## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using Hedera to show your Account Info, Crypto Transfer, Contract Call, Contract Deploy, and chat. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

<!-- If we are able to implement it -->

## Best Use of DeSo

For implementing the chatroom, we are using DeSo. DeSo blockchain is built with custom indexing and storage optimizations which make it 10,000X cheaper to store social content on-chain!

## ⛅ Best Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for database and authentication. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use

## ⚒ Most Creative Use of GitHub

- We are using GitHub for collaboration on code.
- Github Pages for Deploying our web application.
- Enabling the CI/CD for our code.

## 🍻 Dream Big and Create More Cheers with AB InBev

- We dream to make this web app available to all people who have limited access and want to learn more and make their dream come true to learn to learn and grow more.

## 🌐 Best Domain Name from Domain.com

- Any domain with a .tech, .space, or .online extension, for eg. eduministic.tech

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- As all the teammates were from different time zones, it was a bit difficult to collaborate, but we managed to get the project done.
- Some of us did not have any experience with Firebase or back end. We collaborated and helped each other get up to speed. We managed to get most features working.
- We did not have any experience with Hedera. We were able to get most of the features working.
- Delploying the project was a bit tricky. We had to use a lot of time to get the project up and running.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project within the given time frame.
- Implemented most of the features we wanted
- Completed the project with the best use of Hedera, Firebase, and GitHub.

## 📖 What we learned

- We learned how to use the best tools and frameworks to make the project work.
- How to implement Firebase authentication and Firestore database.
- How to use Hedera for the smart contract.
- Deployment of the project.

## 🚀 What's next for Eduministic

- Adding more features to the project.
- Adding more topics to the project.
- Making it completely decentralized.
